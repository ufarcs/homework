# Question 1.
# Using R as a calculator, what is the sum of 15 and 32 save as a variable named answer1?  

answer1 <- 15+32

# Question 2.
# Using R as a calculator, what is the product of 34 and 543 save as answer2?  

answer2 <- 34*543

# Question 3.
# Using R as a calculator, what is the value of 2 raised to the 4th?  
  
answer3 <- 2^4

# Question 4.
# Create a vector of the numbers 3,8,4,2 and give it the name A.

A <- c(3,8,4,2)

# Question 5.
# Create a vector of the characters “monkey”, “rat”, “snake”, and give it the name B.

B <- c("monkey","rat","snake")
  
# Question 6.
# Create a vector of the sequence of numbers between 89 and 143, and give it the name C.  

C <- seq(89,143)
  
# Question 7.
# Create a vector containing 15 of the number 3 – use the rep command, and give it the name D.  
  
D <- rep(3, 15)
  
# Question 8
# What is the 3rd element in the vector A use list indexing?  

answer8 <- A[3]

# Question 9
# What are the last two elements of the vector B use list indexing?  

answer9 <- B[2:3]

# Question 10
# What is the 4th and 30th element in the vector C return them as a list of both elements?

answer10 <- C[c(4,30)]

# Question 11
# What is the sum of all of the elements in the vector D? 

answer11 <- sum(D)

# Question 12
# Add the character “bird” to the end of vector B.

B2 <- c(B, "bird")

# Question 13
# Change the first element in vector D to the number 5.

D2 <- D[1] <- 5

# Question 14
# Multiple vector A by 3 and save the results as vector A2.  

A2 <- A*3

# Question 15
# Add 5 to every element of vector C and save the results as C2. 

C2 <- C+5
